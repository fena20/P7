Note on Uncertainty Ranges:
- Price threshold uncertainty (±$0.015-0.03/kWh) reflects sensitivity to:
  (1) ±10% variation in retrofit effectiveness assumptions
  (2) ±15% variation in HP COP estimates
  (3) ±5% variation in natural gas prices
  
- Emissions reduction ranges reflect:
  (1) Grid emission factor scenarios (current vs. 2030 projection)
  (2) Heating load estimation uncertainty from XGBoost model (R² ≈ 0.50)
