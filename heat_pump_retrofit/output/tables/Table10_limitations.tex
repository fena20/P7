\toprule
Category & Limitation & Impact & Mitigation & Future Work \\
\midrule
Temporal Resolution & No hourly analysis & May underestimate HP performance degradation in extreme cold; does not capture peak load timing & COP curves from field studies used for cold climate HP sizing & Integration with EnergyPlus for hourly simulation \\
Spatial Aggregation & HDD at Census division level & Local climate variability (±500 HDD) not captured; urban/rural differences masked & Results presented with climate band sensitivity analysis & County-level climate data integration \\
Retrofit Effectiveness & Uniform % reduction assumed & Air sealing in leaky homes more effective than in tight homes & Literature-based ranges provided (±30%) & Building simulation-based retrofit curves \\
HP Performance & Annual average COP used & Cold climate COP degradation at T < -5°C not dynamic & Used COP@17°F for cold climate sizing & Temperature-dependent COP curves from NEEP data \\
Emissions Accounting & Direct emissions only & Upstream gas leakage (2-3%) not included; grid average vs marginal emissions & Sensitivity analysis with 2050 grid scenarios & Full lifecycle assessment (LCA) integration \\
Uncertainty Analysis & No Monte Carlo propagation & Parameter correlations not modeled; confidence intervals limited & One-way sensitivity analysis for key parameters & Full probabilistic analysis with correlated inputs \\
Behavioral Factors & Fixed thermostat setpoints & Rebound effects and HP learning curves not modeled & Model residuals analyzed for behavioral patterns & Integration with behavioral survey data \\
Economic Parameters & Static fuel prices & Price volatility and trends not captured & Wide sensitivity range tested (±50%) & Stochastic price modeling \\
