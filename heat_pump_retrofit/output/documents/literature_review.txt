METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES IN LITERATURE:
----------------------------------------
• Engineering models (EnergyPlus, BEopt): High accuracy, low scalability
• Statistical models (regression): Moderate accuracy, high scalability
• Machine learning (RF, XGBoost): High accuracy, high scalability, low interpretability
• Hybrid approaches: Combining ML with SHAP for interpretability

THIS STUDY'S POSITION:
----------------------
Builds on ML approaches (XGBoost) with interpretability (SHAP) and 
uncertainty quantification (Sobol + Monte Carlo) - addressing the gap
between purely statistical and purely engineering approaches.
