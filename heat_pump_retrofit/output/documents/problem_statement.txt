1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------
The U.S. residential sector accounts for approximately 20% of national energy 
consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas furnaces remain
the dominant heating technology in ~48% of American homes, presenting both a 
challenge and an opportunity for decarbonization. Heat pumps (HPs) offer a 
promising pathway to reduce emissions, but their economic viability varies 
significantly across:

  • Climate conditions (Heating Degree Days, HDD)
  • Building envelope quality (insulation, air sealing)
  • Regional energy prices (electricity vs. natural gas)
  • Grid carbon intensity (current and projected)

This study addresses the critical question: Under what conditions is heat pump
adoption economically viable for gas-heated U.S. homes, and how do these 
conditions vary across climate zones and building characteristics?

2. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
----------------------
Primary Objectives:
  1. Develop a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict thermal intensity
     (BTU/sqft/HDD) for gas-heated homes using RECS 2020 microdata.
  
  2. Identify key drivers of heating energy consumption through SHAP analysis.
  
  3. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of HP adoption under various scenarios.
  
  4. Determine "tipping points" where HP adoption becomes economically viable.
  
  5. Quantify sensitivity to grid decarbonization scenarios through 2050.

Secondary Objectives:
  • Validate model against official RECS statistics
  • Perform global sensitivity analysis (Sobol indices)
  • Quantify uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulation
  • Develop policy recommendations for incentive targeting

3. SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES
-----------------------
Included:
  • Single-family and multi-family homes with natural gas heating
  • Air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) including cold-climate variants
  • Building envelope retrofits (insulation, air sealing, windows)
  • 15-year analysis horizon with 5% discount rate
  • Continental U.S. (9 Census divisions)

Excluded:
  • Ground-source heat pumps (higher cost, different economics)
  • New construction (focus on retrofit market)
  • Commercial buildings
  • Hawaii and Alaska (different energy markets)

4. KEY HYPOTHESES
-----------------
H1: HDD and envelope quality are the dominant predictors of HP viability.
H2: Cold climate regions (HDD > 6,000) require envelope retrofit for viability.
H3: Grid decarbonization shifts viability threshold by 2035.
H4: NPV sensitivity is highest for electricity price and COP.

5. EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------------------
Academic:
  • Novel application of XGBoost + SHAP for residential energy modeling
  • Comprehensive viability score framework linking ML to economics
  • Uncertainty quantification through combined Sobol/Monte Carlo analysis

Policy:
  • Identification of priority regions for HP incentives
  • Quantification of retrofit requirements for cold climates
  • Evidence base for state energy office planning

6. DATA SOURCES
---------------
Primary: RECS 2020 Microdata (EIA)
  • n = 18,496 households, filtered to n = 9,411 gas-heated
  • 24 variables covering building, climate, household characteristics

Secondary:
  • EIA Annual Energy Outlook (energy price projections)
  • NREL Electrification Futures Study (technology costs)
  • EPA eGRID (grid carbon intensity)

7. LITERATURE GAP
-----------------
Existing studies (e.g., Deetjen et al. 2021, Buonocore et al. 2022) have:
  ✓ Assessed HP emissions benefits
  ✓ Analyzed aggregate adoption potential
  
Gap addressed by this study:
  ✗ Household-level viability prediction with ML
  ✗ Combined economic + emissions optimization
  ✗ Explicit uncertainty quantification
  ✗ Policy-actionable viability thresholds
